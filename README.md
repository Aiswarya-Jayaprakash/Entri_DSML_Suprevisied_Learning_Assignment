# Entri_DSML_Suprevisied_Learning_Assignment

This assignment is performed using the Breast Cancer dataset is a built-in dataset in the sklearn library which consist of 569 samples with 30 features and a binary classification target (malignant or benign). The preprocessing steps involves checking for missing values and feature scaling. Tha data was split into traning and test data for supervised learning. Finally, The following five classification algorithms was implemented and the best and worst among them for this dataset was compared using their accuracy
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
